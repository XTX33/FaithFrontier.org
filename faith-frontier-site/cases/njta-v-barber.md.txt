summary: >
  The New Jersey Turnpike Authority (“NJTA”) filed a Special Civil Part action
  seeking $5,109.45 in alleged unpaid tolls and administrative fees. Devon Tyler
  Barber, appearing pro se, filed a verified counterclaim asserting that NJTA’s
  enforcement and fee structure exceed statutory authority and violate
  constitutional safeguards and the public-trust doctrine. The matter is now
  proceeding under Judge Dean R. Marcolongo’s October 27, 2025 order permitting
  limited discovery.
faith_note: >
  This case examines whether a public authority can lawfully balance revenue
  collection with the moral and constitutional obligation to treat citizens
  fairly. It frames toll enforcement as a test of stewardship under the
  public-trust doctrine: government may administer what belongs to the people,
  but it must do so with transparency, reason, and restraint.

## Plain-English Overview

**Plaintiff’s claim**  
The NJTA alleges that between 2016 and 2024, vehicles registered to Devon Barber
passed through toll facilities without payment, accruing $204 in tolls and $4,905 in
administrative fees.  It seeks judgment for $5,109.45 plus interest and costs.

**Defendant’s response and counterclaim**  
Barber, representing himself, filed an *Amended Answer and Counterclaim* arguing that:

* NJTA functions as a **statutory corporation**, not a sovereign state entity.  
* A **24-to-1** ratio of fees to tolls exceeds the “reasonable cost” limit in  
  N.J.S.A. 27:23-34.3 / N.J.A.C. 19:9-9.2(b).  
* The fee structure violates the **Excessive Fines Clause** (*Timbs v. Indiana*, 2019).  
* NJTA’s toll operations are bound by the **public-trust doctrine**
  (*Neptune City v. Avon-by-the-Sea*, 61 N.J. 296 (1972)).  
* Private, non-commercial motorists are entitled to proportional, non-punitive treatment.  

Relief sought includes declaratory and injunctive orders defining NJTA’s lawful
authority, barring punitive or ultra vires fees, and reaffirming fiduciary duties to
the traveling public.

**Procedural status**  
On October 27, 2025 Judge Marcolongo placed the matter on Track 1 and authorized
limited discovery.  Barber promptly served interrogatories and document requests
addressing NJTA’s $1.7 billion E-ZPass contract with TransCore, foreign-ownership
and data-privacy questions raised in Congressman Josh Gottheimer’s March 28 2025
letter, and ADA accessibility procedures.  
On November 3, 2025 Barber filed an ADA accommodation request to confirm
scheduling and docketing accuracy.

## Key Legal Themes

1. **Public-Trust Doctrine** — Agencies managing public infrastructure must act as fiduciaries, not profit centers.  
2. **Proportional Penalties** — Administrative fees must reflect actual cost, not serve as punishment or revenue generation.  
3. **Transparency & Data Security** — Examination of the 2024 E-ZPass contract and foreign-vendor oversight.  
4. **ADA Access to Justice** — Emphasizing equal procedural access and accommodation for self-represented litigants.
