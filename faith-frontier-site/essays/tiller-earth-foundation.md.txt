summary: >
  The Tiller Earth Foundation is the spiritual root beneath Faith Frontier —
  a recognition that stewardship, labor, and land are sacred trusts.
  The same conscience that governs fair work also demands fair governance.

## Purpose

**Tiller Earth** began as a vision: that every act of honest work is a form of worship,
and every acre of land — whether farm, home, or road — is entrusted, not owned.

From that understanding, **Faith Frontier Ecclesiastical Trust** was born:
to defend stewardship in law and conscience, ensuring that public authority,
like private labor, remains accountable to truth and fairness.

## Parable of the Soil

Christ compared faith to a seed sown in good ground.
Modern systems often uproot that soil — replacing it with paperwork, fees,
and distant bureaucracies. Yet the moral law remains simple:

> *“To whom much is given, much is required.”* — Luke 12:48

Public power is a sacred trust.  
When governments forget this, the people must remind them — with patience, evidence, and peace.

## Labor, Law, and Light

The tradesman, the judge, the farmer, and the priest are all tillers of the same earth.
When one forgets humility, the others suffer.

Faith Frontier teaches that:
- Labor is holy when it serves others.
- Law is holy when it protects the weak.
- Light is holy when it exposes injustice without hatred.

Each of these is a form of tilling — and every generation must learn it anew.

## Connection to Cases

The same principle behind *Tillerstead LLC*’s honest labor fuels the arguments in
*NJTA v. Barber*: that power is never license to exploit, and
that proportionality, notice, and mercy must guide public enforcement.

You can see how these beliefs unfold in real cases like

## Closing Reflection

*Tiller Earth* is not just a brand or an idea — it’s a reminder:
our work, our rights, and our redemption all grow from the same soil.

To till it well is to worship.
