    <p class="hero-lead">
      A transparent archive at the intersection of <strong>law, faith, and civic integrity</strong> —
      documenting New Jersey legal cases, wage and benefits disputes, detention proceedings, and
      the public systems that govern them.

      Established by a New Jersey tradesman and pro se litigant who spent <strong>108 days in custody before arraignment</strong>,
      navigated wage theft and benefits denials, and now publishes the full record in service of transparency and reform.

      <h2>Faith, Doctrine &amp; Formation Under Pressure</h2>
      <p>
        This isn’t theory written from a distance. These reflections grow out of
        <strong>real pressure</strong>: lost wages, seized time, broken promises, and the fight
        to stay grounded in Scripture while navigating dockets and deadlines.

        Agencies do not just move paperwork; they move lives. Here you can examine how
        toll authorities, motor vehicle agencies, welfare offices, and courts handle
        data, debt, detention, and discretion — and where they fall short of the public trust.

  <h2>Why Faith Frontier Exists</h2>
  <p>
    Faith Frontier was born out of a season where rumors, political speech, and misread records
    were treated as facts — where a tradesman and small-business owner was held for months before
    being seen, where wage disputes and benefits decisions were handled faster on paper than in
    real life, and where conscience had to fight to stay awake.
  </p>
  <p>
    This project turns that experience outward. It is an attempt to reconcile
    <strong>due process, public record, and spiritual honesty</strong> — to show what happens
    not just in opinions and press releases, but in the filings, orders, and delays that shape
    an ordinary life.
  </p>
  <p>
    We believe justice should be accessible, understandable, and compassionate — that the law
    should be measured not only by what it permits, but by what it does to the people it touches.

  <h2>How to Use This Site</h2>
  <div class="how-grid">
    <article class="how-step">
      <h3>1. Start with a Case</h3>
      <p>
        Visit the <a href="{{ '/cases/' | relative_url }}">Cases index</a> and choose a matter —
        for example, <strong>NJTA v. Barber</strong> or a Special Civil Part dispute.
        Each case page lists the filings in order and links to the original PDFs.
      </p>
    </article>
    <article class="how-step">
      <h3>2. Read the Plain-English Notes</h3>
      <p>
        Under each case, follow summaries that explain what a complaint, counterclaim,
        motion, or order <em>actually does</em>, and how it fits into the broader timeline
        (including wage conflicts, benefits appeals, or 108 days of pre-hearing custody).
      </p>
    </article>
    <article class="how-step">
      <h3>3. Connect Law, Policy &amp; Faith</h3>
      <p>
        Move between <a href="{{ '/cases/' | relative_url }}">case pages</a>,
        <a href="{{ '/public-trust/' | relative_url }}">research highlights</a>, and
        <a href="{{ '/faith/' | relative_url }}">faith essays</a> to see how one person’s
        file reflects larger questions: What is proportional? What is merciful? What is true?
