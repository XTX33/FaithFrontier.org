## Overview

This administrative action seeks review of a summary license suspension allegedly
issued through the NJ MVC’s automated “Notice of Proposed Suspension” system.
Barber argues that the notice was never received, and that reinstatement was
contingent on inaccessible online procedures that discriminated against persons
with disabilities.

## Key Issues

1. Whether automated suspension notices meet due process standards under NJ Const. Art. I ¶1.  
2. Whether MVC’s online-only reinstatement portal violates ADA Title II access provisions.  
3. Whether agency discretion in reinstatement must be exercised in good faith as a public trust.
