    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      These coordinated petitions seek post-conviction relief under
      <strong>N.J. Ct. R. 3:22</strong>, alleging violations of the
      <strong>Sixth</strong> and <strong>Fourteenth Amendments</strong>.
      Across the related 2022–2024 matters, the filings assert ineffective
      assistance of counsel, suppression or mishandling of exculpatory
      information, and broader due-process defects in charging,
      adjudication, and post-judgment administration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because the issues and factual records overlap, this page presents
      a unified view of the litigation so that readers can follow the
      constitutional questions without having to reconstruct them from
      multiple, fragmented dockets.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Unified Legal Issues</h2>
    <p>
      The petitions raise interrelated questions of ineffective assistance,
      fair notice, and structural fairness. Among the central issues:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Whether trial counsel’s performance failed the standard set in
        <em>Strickland v. Washington</em>, 466 U.S. 668 (1984), including
        failures to investigate, advise, or preserve critical defenses.
      </li>
      <li>
        Whether exculpatory or mitigating material was withheld, obscured,
        or disclosed in a manner inconsistent with due process and
        the State’s obligations.
      </li>
      <li>
        Whether cumulative procedural irregularities, inconsistent
        treatment across related dockets, or gaps in the record resulted in
        a denial of fundamental fairness under the New Jersey Constitution
        and the Fourteenth Amendment.
      </li>
      <li>
        Whether post-conviction review itself has been compromised by
        administrative delay, fragmented handling, or bias that frustrates
        the remedial purposes of R. 3:22.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Procedural Posture</h2>
    <p>
      The coordinated PCR matters proceed in the Law Division as a unified
      challenge to the underlying convictions and sentences noted above.
      The court has been asked to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Vacate or modify the judgments where constitutional error is established;</li>
      <li>
        Grant an evidentiary hearing on disputed factual questions relevant
        to counsel performance, prejudice, and withheld material; and
      </li>
      <li>
        Clarify the interaction between the related dockets so that any
        relief granted is coherent and enforceable in practice.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="text-muted">

      filings become available.

    <h2>Context & Purpose</h2>
    <p>
      This unified presentation exists to enhance transparency and public
      understanding of New Jersey’s post-conviction review process. By
      consolidating records that would otherwise appear piecemeal across
      multiple dockets and systems, it allows observers to track how
      constitutional claims are raised, answered, and resolved in real time.
    </p>
    <p>
      It also reflects a broader concern: that access to justice should not
      depend on a person’s ability to navigate scattered records or opaque
      procedures. Bringing the materials together in one place is part of
      treating post-conviction review as a public-trust function, not a
      private puzzle.
