## Overview

The New Jersey Turnpike Authority filed this matter seeking recovery of toll-related
charges allegedly incurred through E-ZPass or other automated tolling systems. Barber’s
response challenges the NJTA’s jurisdictional standing and the administrative methods
used to impose and collect tolls.

Following initial pleadings in August and September 2025, Barber filed a counterclaim
asserting violations of the New Jersey Consumer Fraud Act and procedural due process.
Subsequent correspondence documents ADA accommodation requests and ongoing discovery
exchange. The case remains in active pretrial status pending scheduling or mediation.

Additional filings—such as discovery responses, pretrial motions, and orders—should be
