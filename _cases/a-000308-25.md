## Background

This matter arises from the plaintiff’s omnibus motion in
**Barber v. Tumelty, ATL-L-002794-25**, a civil-rights and malpractice
action filed in the Law Division against former counsel. When the trial
court denied relief without oral argument or adequate findings, the
plaintiff timely filed a Notice of Appeal and supporting motion papers
to the Appellate Division.

## Legal Issues

- Whether the Law Division erred by denying unopposed or insufficiently opposed
  relief without the findings required by *R. 1:7-4(a).*  
- Whether the Appellate Division should reinstate the appeal in the interest
  of justice pursuant to *R. 2:8-1* and its equitable authority.  
- Whether due-process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment and Article I, ¶ 1
  of the New Jersey Constitution were infringed by the handling of the motion
  and resulting orders.

fairness and self-represented access to justice in New Jersey’s civil courts,
with particular attention to how trial-level motions are treated when a
litigant appears without counsel.
