## Background
This matter arises from the plaintiff’s omnibus motion in ATL-L-2794-25,
a civil-rights and malpractice action filed in the Law Division against
former counsel. When the trial court denied relief without oral argument,
the plaintiff timely filed a Notice of Appeal and supporting motion papers
to the Appellate Division.

## Legal Issues
- Whether the Law Division erred by denying unopposed relief without proper findings under *Rule 1:7-4(a)*.  
- Whether the Appellate Division should reinstate the appeal in the interest of justice pursuant to *Rule 2:8-1*.  
- Whether due-process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment and Article I, ¶1 of the New Jersey Constitution were infringed.
