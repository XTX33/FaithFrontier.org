summary: >
  The New Jersey Turnpike Authority (“NJTA”) filed a Special Civil Part action
  seeking $5,109.45 in alleged unpaid tolls and administrative fees. Devon Tyler
  Barber, appearing pro se, filed a verified counterclaim asserting that NJTA’s
  enforcement and fee structure exceed statutory authority and violate
  constitutional safeguards and the public-trust doctrine. The matter is
  proceeding under Judge Dean R. Marcolongo’s October 27 2025 order placing the
  case on Track 1 and authorizing limited discovery.

faith_note: >
  This case examines whether a public authority can lawfully balance revenue
  collection with the moral and constitutional obligation to treat citizens
  fairly. It frames toll enforcement as a test of stewardship under the
  public-trust doctrine: government may administer what belongs to the people,
  but it must do so with transparency, reason, and restraint.

## Plain-English Overview

**Plaintiff’s claim**  
The NJTA alleges that between 2016 and 2024, vehicles registered to Devon Barber
passed through toll facilities without payment, accruing $204 in tolls and $4,905 in
administrative fees. It seeks judgment for $5,109.45, plus interest and costs.

**Defendant’s response and counterclaim**  
Barber, representing himself, filed an *Amended Answer and Counterclaim* arguing that:

- NJTA functions as a **statutory corporation**, not a sovereign state entity.  
- A **24-to-1** ratio of fees to tolls exceeds the “reasonable cost” limit in
  N.J.S.A. 27:23-34.3 and N.J.A.C. 19:9-9.2(b).  
- The fee structure violates the **Excessive Fines Clause** (see *Timbs v. Indiana*,
  139 S. Ct. 682 (2019)).  
- NJTA’s toll operations are bound by the **public-trust doctrine**
  (see *Neptune City v. Avon-by-the-Sea*, 61 N.J. 296 (1972)).  
- Private, non-commercial motorists are entitled to proportional, non-punitive treatment.

Relief sought includes declaratory and injunctive orders defining NJTA’s lawful
authority, barring punitive or ultra vires fees, and reaffirming fiduciary duties to
the traveling public.

**Procedural status**  
On October 27 2025, Judge Marcolongo placed the matter on Track 1 and authorized
limited discovery. Barber served interrogatories and document requests addressing
NJTA’s E-ZPass contract with TransCore, foreign-ownership and data-privacy issues
highlighted in Congressman Josh Gottheimer’s March 28 2025 letter, and ADA
accessibility procedures. On November 3 2025, Barber filed an ADA accommodation
request to confirm scheduling and docketing accuracy. On November 5 2025, NJTA
filed an Answer to Counterclaim and Affirmative Defenses.

## Key Legal Themes

1. **Public-Trust Doctrine**  
   Agencies managing public infrastructure must act as fiduciaries, not profit centers,
   administering public assets for the benefit of the people.

2. **Proportional Penalties**  
   Administrative fees must reflect actual costs of collection and enforcement, rather
   than serving as punitive or revenue-generating penalties.

3. **Transparency & Data Security**  
   The case tests how a public authority oversees private vendors handling toll and
   location data, especially where foreign ownership and cybersecurity concerns have
   been raised.

4. **ADA Access to Justice**  
   The matter underscores the importance of clear notices, realistic deadlines, and
   reasonable accommodations so that self-represented litigants can meaningfully
   participate in their own cases.
