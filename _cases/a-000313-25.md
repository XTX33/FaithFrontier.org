## Background
This case originates from a Special Civil Part collection action filed
by the New Jersey Turnpike Authority to recover alleged unpaid tolls.
The defendant, appearing pro se, contested the claim based on lack of
proof of personal liability, improper service, and procedural deficiencies.

## Legal Issues
- Whether NJTA complied with statutory prerequisites under *N.J.S.A. 27:23-34.4*.  
- Whether the trial court maintained jurisdiction absent certified notice.  
- Whether due process and equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment were satisfied.  
- Whether the automated toll-collection framework violates proportionality and notice standards.
