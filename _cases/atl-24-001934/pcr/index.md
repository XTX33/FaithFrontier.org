## Overview

This PCR proceeding arises from Barber’s continuing effort to obtain judicial review of
ineffective assistance of counsel and due-process violations connected to prior criminal
matters in Atlantic County. The filing package includes both a **Demurrer and Plea in
Abatement**, which seeks to halt enforcement of the judgment, and a **Letter to Chief
Clambrone** outlining administrative irregularities in docket handling and case
assignment.

The matter awaits review under **Rule 3:22-10(b)** and potential scheduling for
evidentiary hearing or dismissal without prejudice. Subsequent submissions, including
certifications, State responses, or court orders, should be listed as additional filings
below once received.
