## I. Case Background
The case originates from a **February 2024 street-crossing detention**
by Officer Boyd in Atlantic County.  
Mr. Barber declined to provide identification, asserting his right to privacy.
The encounter escalated into citations and a grand-jury referral, later merged
into **Law Division docket ATL-24-001934**.  

Petitioner argues the incident and resulting prosecution violated the
**Fourth Amendment**, **Fourteenth Amendment**, and **N.J. Const. art. I, ¶¶ 1 & 7**.
He filed for post-conviction relief under *R. 3:22*, then appealed the Law
Division’s failure to properly adjudicate or consolidate the claims.

## IV. Legal Issues
- Whether the detention and identification demand constituted an unlawful stop
  under **Fourth Amendment** and **N.J. Const. art. I, ¶ 7**.  
- Whether **selective enforcement** or retaliation violated **equal-protection**
  and **due-process** rights.  
- Whether appointed counsel’s omissions satisfy the *Strickland/Fritz*
  ineffective-assistance threshold.  
- Whether the Law Division’s inaction and fragmented record deprived petitioner
  of meaningful post-conviction review.

## V. Related Cases and Context
This appeal is part of a larger continuum of public-record PCR and appellate
matters documenting systemic fairness and access to justice:

- [State v. Barber — Unified PCR (ATL-22-002292 / 2313)](/cases/barber-nj-pcr-2022/)  
- [Faith Frontier Case Index](/cases/)  

Together, these cases illustrate how constitutional claims progress through
New Jersey’s hybrid post-conviction and appellate systems.
