## Overview

This case arises from former counsel’s alleged failure to seek timely detention review
during pending criminal charges, resulting in approximately 108 days of pretrial
confinement under harsh conditions. Barber alleges that Tumelty’s omissions and
case-handling decisions contributed to constitutional injury, economic loss, and
emotional harm, and that the conduct supports both legal-malpractice liability and
related statutory claims.

The docket reflects early motions focused on track assignment, fee waiver, and
subpoena practice, followed by an amended complaint, supplemental memorandum in
support of Track III reassignment, and an order formally granting the track change
on November 7, 2025.
