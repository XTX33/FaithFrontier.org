# Faith Frontier Ecclesiastical Trust  
**Site-wide Style, Tone & Theme Guide**

---

## Mission & Message

Faith Frontier transforms mishaps, unlawful persecution, and experiences of brokenness into testimony, stewardship, and hope. Our purpose is to glorify God, offer redemption, and teach the courage to build anew—honoring our lot in New Jersey, stewarding the earth, and marking the seasons through faith and action.

---

## Tone

- **Redemptive & Transparent:**  
  Speak plainly about injustice, hardship, and failure—never conceal, never minimize. Turn suffering into testimony and possibility.
- **Faith-Forward & God-Centered:**  
  Always point back to God’s glory, mercy, and plan. “In weakness, He is strong.”
- **Hopeful & Stewardly:**  
  Emphasize renewal, planting seeds of change, and wise stewardship—of land, law, time, and relationships.
- **Local & Personal:**  
  Root work and witness in New Jersey. Honor real place, daily life, and personal lot. Adopt a humble, dignified voice.
- **Inviting, Not Exclusive:**  
  Welcome all—neighbors, seekers, doubters. Encourage testimony, learning, and shared restoration.
- **Historic & Ecclesiastical:**  
  Draw on ecclesiastical and historic language, Old English script in headings and hero text, parchment aesthetic for backgrounds.

## Theme & Visual Style

- **Visual Elements:**  
  - Parchment textures, scrollwork, earth-tones (creams, browns, deep greens).
  - Old English display and classic serif fonts (`UnifrakturCook`, `EB Garamond`).
  - Structured, manuscript-like sections.
  - Cards, call-outs, timelines—clarity before clutter.
- **Content Structure:**  
  - Major sections (Cases, Essays, Timeline, Revelations) wrapped in elegant "parchment" cards.
  - Navigation is plain and clear—hero banners, action buttons, verse of the day (Geneva Bible focus).

---

## Messaging Pillars

- **Redemptive Transparency:**  
  “What was hidden is now written. Every mistake, unjust verdict, and pain becomes a lesson—a stone in God’s building.”
- **Stewardship:**  
  “Honor your lot, steward the land and season, and live your story as worship.”
- **Invitation to Hope:**  
  “You are welcome here. Your suffering, testimony, and journey matter in God’s plan.”
- **Journey in Place:**  
  “Marked by New Jersey’s courts, soil, and seasons—reaching for eternal restoration.”

## Example Homepage Message

> Faith Frontier turns mishaps and affliction into living testimony. Each record, reflection, and essay seeks to glorify God, plant hope, and teach real stewardship for New Jersey—whatever the season, whatever my lot.

---

## Implementation

- Write every page, post, and collection to embody these tones in headings, section blurbs, and calls-to-action.
- Use parchment/old English theme CSS (`assets/css/parchment.css`) and fonts (`UnifrakturCook`, `EB Garamond`).
- Case records, essays, and notes prefer plain English and faith—never legalese.
- God’s glory and hope lead; stewardship and invitation conclude.
