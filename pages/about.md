  <h1>About Faith Frontier Ecclesiastical Trust</h1>
  <p class="lead">
    <strong>Faith Frontier</strong> documents the intersection of law, conscience, and stewardship —
    preserving public records and moral reasoning as a form of public trust.
  </p>

  <h2>Mission</h2>
  <p>
    The Trust exists to restore integrity and transparency to the civic process, blending
    legal literacy with theological reflection. Each publication — whether a case record,
    essay, or reform brief — is meant to illuminate how justice, equity, and mercy can coexist
    within the same public framework.
  </p>

  <h2>Origins</h2>
  <p>
    Founded by <strong>Devon Tyler Barber</strong> in New Jersey, Faith Frontier arose from direct
    experience in courtrooms, labor disputes, and public agencies. The project began as a record
    of personal litigation and evolved into an ecclesiastical trust — a living ministry of evidence,
    faith, and reform.
  </p>

  <h2>Principles</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Stewardship:</strong> Handle truth and public record with care, not control.</li>
    <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> Let every filing, motion, and act of conscience be visible and verifiable.</li>
    <li><strong>Reform:</strong> Turn personal experience into precedent that serves others.</li>
    <li><strong>Faith:</strong> Keep justice accountable to higher moral law.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Structure</h2>
  <p>
    The Trust operates as an independent, faith-based public-interest record. It is not a law firm
    or political entity, but an educational and moral enterprise. The Proprietor maintains ownership
    of all intellectual and creative property in stewardship for future generations.
