<section class="section-intro">
  <h1>Faith & Doctrine</h1>
  <p class="section-lead">
    Reflections born from work, trial, and grace. Here, faith isn’t theory — it’s how conscience walks through courts, contracts, and the labor of human hands. <br></br>
Faith Frontier began from one truth: that stewardship, law, and livelihood are sacred trusts. These writings trace where Scripture meets structure — covenant meeting constitution, mercy meeting due process — and ask how a person of conscience stands within systems built on paper and power.<br></br>
Each piece is written as both testimony and study: personal, doctrinal, and practical. They are not legal advice, nor bound to any denomination or institution. They are simply the record of a craftsman and litigant learning to serve both the Carpenter and the Court with the same integrity.

    The writings collected here are personal theological and doctrinal reflections.
    They are not legal advice, and they do not represent any church body or denomination.

  <h2>Why Faith Frontier Exists</h2>
  <p>I’ve been outspoken since eighteen — political, opinionated, unafraid to take a stand. But beneath all the filings, motions, and docket numbers sits something simpler: I believe God cares how we treat each other — in business, in court, and in love. <br></p>br> My own record carries both faith and failure. Some wounds came from my choices, others from systems built to break the poor and unconnected. I’m working out my faith in public: repenting where I was wrong, standing firm where the process was wrong, and building something honest in between. <br></br> I’m a builder by trade, a pro se litigant by necessity, and a man still hoping for a family and a future in New Jersey. Faith Frontier is where those worlds meet — where paperwork and prayer share the same table, and where anyone can see how conscience, Scripture, and law collide in real life. <br></br> It exists because mercy and justice aren’t opposites. They’re the same pursuit, carried out with clean hands.
  </p>
  <p>
    My own record was shaped by fear, money, and misapplied charges. I’m working out my
    faith in public: repenting where I was wrong, standing firm where the process was
    wrong, and trying to build something honest in the middle. I’m a builder by trade,
    a pro se litigant by necessity, and a man who still hopes for a family and a future
    in New Jersey.
  </p>
  <p>
    Faith Frontier is where those worlds meet. It’s a place to lay out the paperwork and
    the prayers side by side, so anyone can see how conscience, Scripture, and law collide
    in real life — and how mercy and justice are still worth fighting for.
