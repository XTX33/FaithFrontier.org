  <h1>Court &amp; Case Transparency</h1>
  <p class="section-lead">
    This page explains how to read the cases documented on Faith Frontier —
    what it means when something is in the trial court, the Appellate Division,
    or post-conviction review, and how filings and rulings fit together.
  </p>
  <p class="text-muted">
    Nothing here is legal advice. I’m not a lawyer. I’m a tradesman and pro se
    litigant documenting my own matters so others can understand what is being
    done in their name, and what options might exist when the process feels
    stacked against them.

  <h2>How New Jersey Courts Are Stacked</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Municipal &amp; trial courts:</strong> where charges, complaints, and most day-to-day hearings start.</li>
    <li><strong>Law Division / Criminal:</strong> indictments, pleas, sentencing, probation terms.</li>
    <li><strong>Appellate Division:</strong> reviews legal errors and timing issues, like “leave to file as within time.”</li>
    <li><strong>PCR (Post-Conviction Relief):</strong> where you challenge ineffective assistance of counsel and constitutional violations after conviction.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The same life event can show up in more than one place — for example, a plea
    in the Law Division, a PCR motion in the trial court, and a late appeal
    request in the Appellate Division. Faith Frontier connects those dots.

  <h2>Where to See the Actual Cases</h2>
  <p>
    If you want the raw dockets and filings, start here:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a href="{{ '/cases/' | relative_url }}">Cases Index</a> —
      all active and archived matters in one place.
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="{{ '/live-dockets/' | relative_url }}">Live Dockets &amp; Explanations</a> —
      upcoming dates and next steps, in plain English.
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="{{ '/public-trust/' | relative_url }}">Public-Trust Cases</a> —
      matters that raise bigger questions about how agencies use power.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Why This Transparency Work Matters</h2>
  <p>
    Court records are public, but they’re not always understandable. Without
    context, a docket can make a working person look dangerous, irresponsible,
    or hopeless when the real story is about bad counsel, withheld evidence, or
    economic pressure.
  </p>
  <p>
    By pairing official filings with honest explanation, I’m trying to show how
    justice actually feels on the ground — and why due process, accurate
    records, and mercy matter for anyone trying to work, rent, and love in New
    Jersey.
