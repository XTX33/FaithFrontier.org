  <h1>Court & Case Transparency</h1>
  <p class="section-lead">
    This section documents and explains real legal matters involving
    <strong>Devon Tyler Barber</strong> and the <strong>Faith Frontier Ecclesiastical Trust</strong>.
    Each case is presented in plain English to help readers understand how filings, hearings,
    and rulings connect to the larger issues of public trust, due process, and access to justice
    within New Jersey courts.

  <p class="text-muted">
    The purpose of this archive is educational and ethical: to make complex proceedings readable
    and transparent, and to encourage lawful, faith-grounded engagement with civil and
    administrative systems. It is not a substitute for legal advice.

  <h2>Mission of the Court Project</h2>
  <p>
    Faith Frontier’s Court & Cases project seeks to bridge faith, fairness,
    and formal procedure—demonstrating that truth and mercy can coexist within law.
    By publishing real filings and outcomes, we aim to:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Improve public understanding of New Jersey’s civil and chancery processes;</li>
    <li>Encourage ethical advocacy and transparency in all proceedings;</li>
    <li>Document each case as part of an honest pursuit of equity and restoration.</li>
  </ul>

    “He has told you, O man, what is good; and what does the Lord require of you
    but to do justice, to love mercy, and to walk humbly with your God.” — Micah 6:8
