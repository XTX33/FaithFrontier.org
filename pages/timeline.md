      From 2022 to present, these cases unfold in a pattern that cannot be dismissed

          <p>
            The journey begins with criminal prosecutions in Atlantic County. What appears
            as ordinary criminal cases will later reveal systemic due process failures,
            ineffective counsel, and prosecutorial overreach.

            In 2025, the full pattern emerges. Post-conviction petitions, civil malpractice
            claims, federal civil rights actions, and toll enforcement cases all converge

            Comprehensive post-conviction relief petitions filed across all criminal dockets,

  <div class="container">
    <h2>Patterns Revealed Over Time</h2>
    <p class="lead">
      Looking at this timeline, several clear patterns emerge—patterns that point to
      God's purpose in allowing these trials:
    </p>

    <div class="patterns-grid">
      <article class="pattern-card">
        <h3>Pattern 1: Progressive Complexity</h3>
        <p>
          Cases start simple (criminal prosecutions) but grow more complex as deeper
          issues are revealed (civil rights violations, legal malpractice, systemic
          fee abuses). Each layer exposes another dimension of injustice.
        </p>
        <p class="pattern-meaning">
          <strong>Meaning:</strong> God doesn't reveal everything at once. Truth unfolds
          progressively, as we're ready to handle it and as the evidence builds
          undeniable proof.
        </p>
      </article>

      <article class="pattern-card">
        <h3>Pattern 2: Interconnected Failures</h3>
        <p>
          The same institutional failures appear across different systems: courts, police,
          prosecutors, public defenders, toll authorities. This isn't coincidence—it's
          culture.
        </p>
        <p class="pattern-meaning">
          <strong>Meaning:</strong> Individual bad actors matter, but systemic problems
          require systemic solutions. Reform must address culture, not just individuals.
        </p>
      </article>

      <article class="pattern-card">
        <h3>Pattern 3: Escalating Vindication</h3>
        <p>
          Early cases face dismissal or delay, but later cases gain traction: fee waivers
          granted, track reassignments approved, discovery authorized. The tide is turning.
        </p>
        <p class="pattern-meaning">
          <strong>Meaning:</strong> Patience and persistence matter. Justice may be delayed,
          but with faithful stewardship of evidence and argument, it cannot be permanently
          denied.
        </p>
      </article>

      <article class="pattern-card">
        <h3>Pattern 4: From Reactive to Proactive</h3>
        <p>
          Early cases are defensive (responding to prosecutions). Later cases are offensive
          (asserting civil rights, challenging fee structures, demanding accountability).
        </p>
        <p class="pattern-meaning">
          <strong>Meaning:</strong> God uses trials to transform victims into advocates,
          teaching not just to endure injustice but to challenge it and prevent it from
          harming others.
        </p>
      </article>

<section class="section section-future" aria-label="What Comes Next">
  <div class="container">
    <h2>What Comes Next?</h2>
    <p class="lead">
      The timeline is not complete. Cases are still pending, appeals are still being
      perfected, and discovery is ongoing. But the direction is clear.
    </p>

    <div class="future-outlook">
      <h3>Upcoming Milestones</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>PCR Decisions:</strong> Rulings on post-conviction petitions will determine
            whether constitutional violations are acknowledged and remedied</li>
        <li><strong>Discovery Completion:</strong> NJTA toll case discovery may reveal systemic
            issues with foreign vendor contracts, data security, and fee structures</li>
        <li><strong>Appellate Briefing:</strong> A-000308-25 and A-000313-25 appeals will test
            access to justice and fair procedures at appellate level</li>
        <li><strong>Malpractice Discovery:</strong> ATL-L-002794-25 discovery will expose
            defense counsel's failures and may produce evidence relevant to PCR claims</li>
        <li><strong>Federal Rulings:</strong> IFP and screening decisions in federal civil
            rights cases will determine whether constitutional claims proceed to discovery</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>The Ultimate Goal</h3>
      <p>
        These cases exist not for their own sake, but to serve a higher purpose:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>To <strong>vindicate truth</strong> where it has been suppressed</li>
        <li>To <strong>establish precedent</strong> that protects future litigants</li>
        <li>To <strong>expose systemic failures</strong> that harm countless others</li>
        <li>To <strong>witness God's justice</strong> in the midst of human imperfection</li>
        <li>To <strong>build Faith Frontier</strong> as a resource for others facing similar trials</li>
      </ul>
