## Case Overview

This federal civil-rights action is brought under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. Barber alleges
that multiple individual officers, contractors, and municipal entities violated
his constitutional rights in connection with arrest, detention conditions, and
medical care.

The case was initially **administratively terminated** on November 3 2023 for
failure to keep the court informed of a current mailing address, and later
**dismissed** by Memorandum Opinion and Order dated December 20 2023. After
updating his address, Barber filed an **Amended Complaint** and a **Motion to
Reopen** on September 2 2025. The docket reflects these submissions as entries
6–9, and the motion remains pending.

Further updates will be added when the court rules on the Motion to Reopen.
