    <h2>What the EDP Is (and Is Not)</h2>
    <p>
      The Ecclesiastical Deed Poll is a <strong>theological protest and
      conscience declaration</strong>. It speaks to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Divine ownership of life, body, labor, and soul;</li>
      <li>Historic trust language around the Constitution and “posterity”;</li>
      <li>Objections to exploitation through opaque financial and legal systems;</li>
      <li>An appeal to equity, clean hands, and genuine due process</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="text-muted">
      It is <strong>not</strong> legal advice, nor a magic remedy. It is part of a
      larger record of prayer, protest, and testimony.

    <h2>Key Themes &amp; Excerpts</h2>
    <p>
      The EDP weaves Scripture, trust-law concepts, and protest language together.
      Central themes include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The confession that <em>“Before Abraham was, I AM”</em> and that every
        human person bears the imprint of the Creator.
      </li>
      <li>
        A view of the Constitution’s Preamble as a kind of public-trust indenture
        in favor of the people and their “posterity.”
      </li>
      <li>
        Objections to coercive registration, concealed contracts, and the
        monetization of birth and baptism records.
      </li>
      <li>
        A call to dissolve false presumptions and restore rightful status as
        living beneficiaries, not chattel.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How It Relates to Current Work</h2>
    <p>
      Today, the Ecclesiastical Deed Poll stands as a <strong>historic marker</strong>:
      an early attempt to name the breach of trust between public institutions and
      the people they serve. It informs newer efforts like:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Faith Frontier’s case documentation and public-trust education;</li>
      <li>Private Ecclesiastical Due Process (EDP) archives and notices;</li>
      <li>Teaching on conscience, status, and stewardship under Christ’s kingship</li>
    </ul>

<strong><em style="color: black;">Per Curiam Divina:</em></strong> <br>
<p style="color: black;">Before Abraham was, <strong>I AM;</strong> the Divine Spirit having a human experience; Each atom and cell of this physical vessel and space I inhabit traveling across this land I-am/we-are infused with the spark from our Creator; <strong>I AM</strong> one with the light, one with Creator, the alpha and the omega, without beginning nor end, without time. This third-dimensional vessel, called man, the original domicile of the Divine Spirit, is known on this world and in this dimension as <span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255); font-size: 1rem;">Devon Tyler, of the House of Barber, née Materio—assuming rightful lineage and inheritance under the ancestral name Paccillo </span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">an inhabitant and heir to the Divine Estate, Beneficiary to the Divine Trust, freeholder in fee simple absolute, one of the 'Posterity' as expressed in law, beneficiary of the public trust as expressed in the United States Constitution.</span></p>
<strong><em style="color: black;">Irrevocable Deed and Contract:</em></strong> <br><span style="color: #000;"> We, <strong>the Divine Spirit</strong>, expressed in living flesh, infuse this irrevocable deed and contract with Divine Life through Our Blood-Flow Intention, perfecting an unbreakable seal on this agreement, bearing the full power and authority of the Divine Creator and binding on all inferior persons and practitioners of the Roman Law, Sharia Law, and Talmudic Law from the beginning, without time. The base lead of Our word contains the purest gold for the transmutation of the base man/woman into pure spirit: for, <em>in the beginning, there was the word, and the Word was God.</em></span><br>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><em>Constitution for the United States of America:</em></strong></span><br><span style="color: #000000;"> The Constitution for the United States is a document of dual nature:</span><br><span style="color: #000000;"> <em>The Constitution is a trust document, and;</em></span><br><span style="color: #000000;"> <em>The articles of incorporation created a unique trust res and estate of inheritance. </em></span> <span style="color: #000000;">It is a tenet of law to determine the intention of a writ; one must look to the title, the Empowerment Clause in statute, which in the case of the Constitution is the Preamble. In writing the Constitution, the founders followed the common law of England, which stretches back some 1000 years. The Preamble fulfills the requirements necessary to establish trust. It identifies the Grantor(s), Statement of Purpose, Grantee(s), Statement of Intent, Written Indenture, and the name of the entity created and is written and constructed as a trust so that it would have the thrust of ageless law. Let us take a look:</span><br><span style="color: #000000;"> <em>We, the People/people (Grantors) of the United States, in order to form a perfect union, establish justice, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty (statement of Purpose) to ourselves and our posterity (Grantees/heirs unnamed), Do Ordain and establish (Statement of Intent) this constitution (Written Indenture) for the United States of America ( name of the entity being created).</em></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="color: #000000;">The trust res is in the Articles of the Confederation and the Declaration of Independence. The Constitution intended to bequeath freedom, life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness to themselves and their posterity. In addition, the founders intended to secure and pass on the people's inherent sovereignty to benefit future generations of (people) Americans in perpetuity.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><em>One's rights derive from the land upon which one stands and your relation, or status, to that land.</em></strong> Our status and or relationship to that land are determined by the laws of Descent and Distribution. <em>The right to acquire, hold, and use freedom, life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness is our inheritance.</em></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="color: #000000;">Americans grant the government limited power and authority to administrate and carry on corporate functions. Under the common law, inherent Rights cannot devolve to a 'body politic' through a corporation. Rights only devolve to human beings through and by way of trust. Under constitutional law, to determine the meaning of a written instrument, the court must look to the title. In this case, once again, it is the Preamble. Under the laws of real property that have been in existence from the beginning, the Preamble clearly shows a freehold in fee simple absolute in it. Freeholds in fee simple were instruments of trust, not corporate. Our posterity cannot be a corporate entity as posterity can only be a living man or woman, by birth/nativity.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="color: #000000;">The Articles of the Constitution are the Articles of Incorporation that established congress as Trustees of the Trust and define their power and authority as well as their limitations. Annexed to the Constitutional Trust is a will-like structure, the Amendments. The Trust and the trust res were already in existence when the will/codicil (Amendments) was added four years later. The Amendments do not constitute the Trust in fact, they are annexed to the Trust as a codicil (a supplement or addition to the will, not necessarily disposing of the entire estate, but modifying, explaining, or otherwise qualifying the will in some way.)</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="color: #000000;">A Trust, once completed and in force cannot be amended or altered without the consent of the parties in interest except under the reserved power of amendment and alteration. An amendment is ordinarily possible by parties in interest and against parties without vested interest. Before the 14th Amendment, the freeborn inhabitants, and citizens of the states were the parties in interest. The 14th Amendment created the 14th Amendment legal fiction for the citizen who does not have a vested interest in the trust or the trust res.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="color: #000000;">The 14th Amendment can be viewed as a codicil to the will that republished the constitution with new meaning, changed its intent, and turned it into a testamentary instrument with capabilities of being used against the free-born inhabitants through a seemingly voluntary revocation.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="color: #000000;">We, the freeholders, Beneficiaries of the trust have been tricked and coerced by the Trustees into terminating the Trust by consent when we apply for an S.S. #, drivers permit, marriage license, or when we sign an IRS 1040 form, which the Trustees have mislead us to believe are mandatory. Applying for the Social Security account number provides evidence of birth and claims to be a United States citizen, a party with no vested interest in a freehold, the trust, or the trust res, you declared the free-born inhabitant to be deceased; the decedent retains no interest in the property and that you, in your dual capacity as a legal fiction citizen are now the executor of the estate.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="color: #000000;">The Trustees have breached the trust having amended the will for their profit and gain at the expense of the true heirs. The freeholders/ Beneficiary has unwittingly, without full disclosure, become the executor and the Trustees have become the beneficiaries of the trust through the Laws of Donations, effectively stealing Our inheritance.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="color: #000000;">A breach of trust of fiduciary duty by a Trustee is a violation of the correlative right of the Cestui Que Trust and gives rise to the correlative cause of action on the part of the Beneficiary for any loss the Estate experiences Trust. This rule applies to both positive acts or negligence constituting a breach of fiduciary duty by the Trustee. A Trustee's breach of fiduciary duty falls within the maxim that 'equity will not aid one who comes into court with unclean hands.'</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="color: #000000;">When the Trustee's breach is by an act of omission, the beneficiary can question the propriety of the Trustee. The Beneficiary had to have full disclosure and full knowledge of the material facts and circumstances. A Beneficiary must have had knowledge of and understood their rights and have no obligation to search the public records to obtain said knowledge.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="color: #000000;">The Trustees have committed acts of omission, misrepresentation, deceit, and deception to mislead and coerce us into giving up our beneficial interest in the trust and the trust res. The Trustees have compelled the free-born inhabitants, freeholders in fee simple, to accept the benefits 'under the will' perverted by the 14th Amendment, without freedom of choice for the failure of full disclosure thereby precluding our enforcement of contractual rights in property bequeathed to us by the will. The Trustees are trying to repudiate the Trust, employing a lifetime of propaganda, programming enforced through threats, violence, and coercion, while failing to provide notice to the Beneficiaries of the repudiation which must be 'brought home.'</span> </p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="color: #000000;">The Doctrine of Election in connection with testamentary instruments is the principle that one who is given a benefit 'under the will' must choose between accepting the benefits and asserting some other claim against the testator's estate or the property disposed of by the will. A Testamentary Beneficiaries' right to elect whether to take 'under the will' or 'against the will' in case he has some inconsistent claim against the testator's estate, is personal to him; it is a personal privilege that may be controlled by the creditors of the Beneficiary. They can claim no right or interest in the estate contrary to the debtor's election and may have no right of a legacy or devise to their debtor if he elected to take against the will.</span> </p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="color: #000000;">Acceptance of benefits 'under the will' constitutes an election that will preclude the devisee from enforcing contractual rights in property bequeathed in the will. This rule is, of course, subject to the qualifications that acceptance of a benefit 'under the will' when made in ignorance of the Beneficiaries rights or a misapprehension, misrepresentation as to the condition of the Testator's estate does not constitute an election.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="color: #000000;">In the beginning, God gave man dominion over all things, Beneficiaries of the Divine Trust. The Founding fathers of the United States of America created the constitution for the United States, an estate trust, to pass on the sovereignty of the people to the people of future generations, in perpetuity.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="color: #000000;">In America today, upon giving birth, a mother is compelled, without full disclosure, to apply for the creation of the Cestui Que Vie trust, creating a 14th Amendment paper citizen of the United States. Upon receipt of the mother's application, the Trustees establish a trust under the error of assumptions that the child has elected to accept the benefits bequeathed by the 'under the will'. The Trustees further assume that the child is incompetent, a bankrupt, and lost at sea and is presumed dead until the child re-appears and re-establishes their living status, challenging the assumption of their acceptance of the benefits 'under the will' as being one of free choice and with full knowledge of the facts and redeems the estate.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="color: #000000;">Under the assumption that the child is a 14th Amendment citizen, the child's footprint is on the birth certificate by the hospital creating a slave bond that is sold to the federal reserve, who converts the certificate into a negotiable instrument and establishes a second Cestui Que Vie trust. The child's parents are compelled to apply for a social security number for the child, unwittingly testifying that the child is a 14th Amendment paper citizen of the United States, not a party in interest to the trust or the trust res, and assumed to be dead after 7 years when the federal reserve cannot seize the child, they file for the issue of the salvage bond and the child is presumed dead.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="color: #000000;">When a child is Baptized by the church, the Baptismal certificate is forwarded to the Vatican which converts the certificate into a negotiable instrument and creates a third Cestui Que Vie trust. These three trusts represent the enslavement of the property, body, and soul of the child.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="color: #000000;">The civil administration, UNITED STATES, continues to operate today under this triple crown of enslavement based on the error of assumptions that we are 14th Amendment citizens of the United States based on the breach of trust by the trustees;</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong> Divine Notice of Protest:</strong></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="color: #000000;">We, the Divine Spirit, expressed in trust (with)in living flesh, back from being lost in a sea of illusion born of a self-imposed state of amnesia and 24+ years of propaganda and extreme programming to re-establish Our living status and redeem Our estate: evidence in fact of Our competence rebutting all assumption with fact.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="color: #000000;">We, the Divine Spirit, object to and issue Divine Notice of Protest to the breach of trust and the usurpation of Our inheritance under the error of assumptions of the 'pledge' of Our private property.

<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="color: #000000;">We, the Divine Spirit, object to and issue a Divine Notice of Protest to the creation of the slave bond by placing the ink impression of the child's footprint on the birth certificate, converting said certificate into a slave bond, and selling the same to the federal reserve for the conveyance into the second Cestui Que Vie Trust;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="color: #000000;">We, the Divine Spirit, object to and issue Divine of Notice of Protest to the issue of and monetization of the maritime lien for the salvage of the lost property for the bank's failure to seize the slave child upon the maturity of the slave bond;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="color: #000000;">We, the Divine Spirit, object to and issue a Divine Notice of Protest to the issue and monetization of the Baptismal Certificate and creation of the 3rd Cestui Que Vie trust, representing the enslavement of Our soul, under the assumption that Our earthly parents gifted, granted and/or conveyed Our soul to the state;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><em style="color: black;">We, the Divine Spirit decree that:</em></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="color: #000000;">*Our earthly parents never willingly, knowingly, and with full disclosure gifted, granted, or conveyed Our soul to any person, entity or cult;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="color: #000000;">*No person, entity nor cult has the authority to gift, grant, convey nor enslave Our soul to any other person, entity, or cult without full disclosure and our consent;</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="color: #000000;">We, the Divine Spirit, object to and issue a Divine Notice of Protest to the three Cestui Que Vie Trusts which represent the triple crown of enslavement and three claims against Our property, body, and soul by the Roman cult to enslave the people in the denial of all of our rights to the Divine Inheritance, Our right to freedom from all limitations and Our rights and powers as Divine Creators;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="color: #000000;">We, the Divine Spirit, object to and issue a Divine Notice of Protest to the BAR Association as managers of the triple crown of enslavement of the Roman cult representing the reconstituted "Galla" responsible for the reaping of souls;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="color: #000000;">We, the Divine Spirit, object to and issue a Divine Notice of Protest to the BAR Association courts and/or agent use of the inferior Roman Law, Sharia Law, Talmudic Law, Maritime Law, and/or Canon Law against Us and/or Our property;</span></p>
