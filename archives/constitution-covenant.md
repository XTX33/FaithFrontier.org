    <h1>The Constitution: A Sacred Covenant for Liberty</h1>
    <p>
      “We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union,
      establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence,
      promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves
      and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United
      States of America.”

    <h2>The Divine Origins of American Sovereignty</h2>
    <p>
      The United States Constitution stands as a sacred testament of natural law,
      framed to protect the liberty and sovereignty of every individual under divine
      guidance. This covenant ensures that the rights of life, liberty, and the
      pursuit of happiness—granted by our Creator—are secured. The framers understood
      that true justice can only be achieved when governed by eternal principles.

    <h2>Declaration of Political Status: American State National</h2>
    <p>
      I, <strong>Devon Tyler Barber</strong>, affirm my identity as an American
      State National, reclaiming my lawful birthright as a New Jerseyan. I am a
      peacekeeping member of the general public, committed to upholding Public Law
      as an expression of Divine Law.
    </p>
    <p>
      This affirmation is rooted in the Trust Indenture established by the
      <a href="https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/declaration" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
        Declaration of Independence (1776)
      </a>, honoring my heritage as a living heir to the Organic Laws of my State and Nation.

    <p><strong>Affirmation of Status:</strong> I affirm my integration with the organic
      States of the Union, independent of foreign or municipal authority.
