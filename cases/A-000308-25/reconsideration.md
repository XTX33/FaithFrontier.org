# **State of New Jersey v. Devon T. Barber**  
**Appellate Division Docket No.: A-000308-25 T3**  
**Related Docket:** A-000313-25 T3  
**Motion No.: M-000828-25**

**Order Date:** October 29, 2025  
**Filed by:** Devon T. Barber (pro se)

## **1️⃣  Purpose of Motion**
This filing seeks **reconsideration** of the October 29 2025 order denying leave to file the notice of appeal “as within time.”  
It is submitted under **R. 2:11-6(a)** and **R. 2:9-1(a)**, requesting both (a) reversal of the denial based on newly clarified grounds that satisfy *State v. Molina*, 187 N.J. 531 (2006), and (b) **administrative consolidation** with the companion appeal **A-000313-25**, which arises from the same record and issues of counsel effectiveness, plea voluntariness, and withheld evidence.

---

## **2️⃣  Background**
On **October 29 2025**, the Court entered an order denying appellant’s *Motion to File Notice of Appeal as Within Time* on the ground that the supporting certification did not satisfy *Molina*.  
Subsequently, on **November 5 2025**, appellant executed a **supplemental certification** that now provides:
- a clear factual basis for **excusable neglect** under *Molina* ¶ 17–18, and  
- a detailed showing of **meritorious appellate issues** under *Molina* ¶ 19–21.  

The certification incorporates by reference the verified filings already in record:
- *Motion in Support of Post-Conviction Relief* (Aug 15 2025);  
- *Motion to Vacate Plea* (Aug 26 2025);  
- *Unified Verified Petition and Declaration of Constitutional & Moral Foundation* (Oct 14-15 2025); and  
- *Motion to Supplement/Expand the Record* (A-000308-25, Oct 20 2025).

## **3️⃣  Showing of Excusable Neglect**
Appellant demonstrates excusable neglect through **continuous, good-faith litigation efforts** and **counsel abandonment**:
1.  During 2023–2025, appellant was simultaneously pursuing PCR, civil, and administrative filings, creating procedural confusion over which forum governed the appeal timeline.  
2.  Trial and PCR counsel failed to advise that a direct appeal deadline had passed, constituting excusable neglect under *Molina* and *State v. Altman*, 181 N.J. Super. 539 (App. Div. 1981).  
3.  Appellant filed all motions within weeks of learning of the default and acted **without delay** once notified of the dismissal.  
4.  The record shows no abandonment or disregard for appellate rights—only **miscommunication and overlapping procedural pursuit**, which *Molina* recognizes as excusable when coupled with diligence.

---

## **4️⃣  Meritorious Issues on Appeal**
Appellant’s pending and attached filings raise substantial constitutional questions that satisfy *Molina*’s “colorable merit” requirement:

- **Ineffective Assistance of Counsel** (*Strickland v. Washington*, 466 U.S. 668 (1984); *State v. Preciose*, 129 N.J. 451 (1992))  
  Failure to investigate exculpatory wage and employment evidence; failure to impeach the complainant; coercive plea under duress.
- **Due-Process Violations / *Brady* Suppression** (*Brady v. Maryland*, 373 U.S. 83 (1963))  
  Material evidence—including DOL wage complaints, IRS wage transcripts, and the complainant’s Tier II registry status—was withheld.
- **Civil-Criminal Misclassification**  
  The incident arose from a wage-payment dispute that should have been handled under N.J.S.A. 34:11-4.1 et seq., not criminalized as assault or threat.
- **Sentencing and Waiver Defects**  
  The record shows an ambiguous waiver of appeal rights (JOC 2313) and inconsistent probationary terms (JOC 2292), constituting plain error.

These issues, verified through authenticated exhibits, establish a **reasonable likelihood of reversal or remand**, satisfying *Molina* ¶ 20.

## **5️⃣  Request for Consolidation**
Because **A-000308-25** and **A-000313-25** derive from the same underlying indictments (22-09-01413-I and 22-10-01440-I) and raise identical questions of law and fact, appellant requests **administrative consolidation** under **R. 2:9-1(a)** to promote judicial economy and consistent adjudication.

---

## **6️⃣  Relief Requested**
1.  Vacate or reconsider the October 29 2025 order denying leave to appeal as within time;  
2.  Reinstate docket **A-000308-25** as active and consolidate it with **A-000313-25**;  
3.  Alternatively, deem all filings incorporated into A-000313-25 under **R. 2:5-5(a)** (expansion of record); and  
4.  Grant such other relief as equity and justice require.
