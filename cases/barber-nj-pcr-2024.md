    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
      This post-conviction relief petition is brought under
      <strong>N.J. Ct. R. 3:22</strong>, asserting ineffective assistance of
      counsel and related constitutional violations under the Sixth and Fourteenth
      Amendments. The petition focuses on counsel’s failure to investigate and
      present key mitigating evidence identified both before and after sentencing.

      <li>Whether uninvestigated mitigation would have affected plea or sentencing outcomes.</li>
      <li>Whether due process and fundamental fairness were compromised in the underlying proceedings.</li>
