## Case Background
The 2024 case under docket **ATL-24-001934** originated after a street-level encounter in which 
law enforcement demanded identification absent any articulable suspicion of wrongdoing.  
Mr. Barber maintains that his conduct was lawful and peaceful, and that subsequent charges 
and grand-jury escalation constituted retaliation and a violation of his rights under the 
Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments.
